# restaurant-page

This is the Repository for the Restaurant-Page Assignment of the Odin-Project.

## What I Learned

-   **Webpack:**
    -   Understood the basics of module bundling, which involves packaging various modules (JavaScript files, stylesheets, images, etc.) into a single or multiple bundles.
    -   Configured `webpack.config.js` to manage the build process, including setting up loaders for handling different file types and plugins for optimizing the output.
    -   Implemented entry and output points to define the start and end of the dependency graph.
    -   Utilized development and production modes to optimize build performance and output.
-   **ES6 Modules:**
    -   Learned how to split the code into multiple ES6 modules to improve maintainability and modularity.
    -   Used `import` and `export` statements to manage dependencies between modules and organize code more effectively.
